Purpose: JavaScript No-Instructor team project for Aug-Sept 2018

A budgeting app designed to take in a user's income and the amount they desire to spend on six different categories: Rent, Bills, Groceries, Entertainment, Personal Care, and Miscellaneous; then allow them to track their spending and return their balance, for their universal spending as well as within each category. The user can also specify the length of time the budget is meant to be used for, as well as designate start and end dates for their budget. All expense data is logged in a table with newest expenses displayed at the top of the list, and local storage is enabled to retain budget and expense data across multiple browser visits. Creating a new budget will wipe old data and create new data, allowing for unlimited uses of the application.
